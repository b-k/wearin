There's a phrase, 'played that song so often I wore out the grooves'. This was in fact
possible, just as it's possible to play a cassette tape so many times it snaps.

This program provides the equivalent with digital media. Each time it runs, e.g.

glitch popsong.mp3

it randomly flips 50 bytes in the song (i.e., applies a bitwise not). 


Using it: better music players offer a pre-play and post-play hook, where you can insert
commands. Put this there.

Compiling

Buckle up, because unlike Python et al, you'll have to compile this program. To do so, type

`gcc glitch.c`

at the command prompt. You should now see the executable `glitch` next to the source, `glitch.c`.

* Why 50 bytes? Because mp3 is a surprisingly reliable format, and the odds are good that
most of the inserted glitches have no effect at all.

* Warning: don't wear headphones! Glitching can sometimes manifest in suddenly very loud noises.
